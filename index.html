    <p>I’m an interim senior manager of digital and IT teams. I specialise in modernising technology delivery within organisations – setting the strategy, putting the programme of work together, organising the team with the right people in the right roles.</p>
    <p>Right now, I am interim Head of Technology Services at Horsham District Council. I live in Worthing, in West Sussex in the UK.</p>
