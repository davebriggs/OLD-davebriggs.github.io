    <h1>Hello, I'm Dave!</h1>
    <p>I’m an interim senior manager of digital and IT teams. I specialise in modernising technology delivery within organisations – setting the strategy, putting the programme of work together, organising the team with the right people in the right roles. I mostly work in the public sector, although I have a fair bit of experience in the community and voluntary sector as well.</p>
    <p>Right now, I am interim Head of Technology Services at Horsham District Council. I live in Worthing, in West Sussex in the UK.</p>
    <p>If, for some reason, you'd like to see my CV, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pNOs2KTyWssOhHy4RjmysOg_nfziT_sMHuItP9_EF58/edit?usp=sharing">you can do so</a>. I look a bit like <a href="db-social.png">this</a>.</p>
    <p>I'm interested in helping out community, voluntary or charitable groups and organisations with their approaches to technology. If this sounds like a need you have, please get in touch.</p>
